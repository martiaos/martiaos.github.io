#  You've found the seventh post!

_Munchmuseet_ houses over over half of Edvard Munch's production of paintings, and has in total more than 1200 paintings, 18.000 prints, six sculptures as well as 500 plates, 2.240 books and various other items.

The arguably most famous paintings, _The Scream_ and _Madonna_ were stolen from the museum by armed robbers in broad daylight in august 2004. They were recovered by police 8 days later.
