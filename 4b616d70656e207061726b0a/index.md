#  You've found the eight post!

Beneath the pond at the top of _Kampen Park_ is a large water reservoir built in 1886 to help supply the nearby communities of Kampen.

### Task

_What is the name of the horse in our office?_

### Clue to next post:

_On the top of the world, a grand white building._

(Or grey. Or brown? Maybe #808080? It's certainly magnificent, with a rather dominating view!)

(Extra hint: Not the building itself, but a nearby bus stop :bus:)
