#  Well done, you've found the second post!

This stone statue called _Vindfruen_ made by Ole Kristian Sjølie was originally intended to be floating statue anchored up in the Oslo fjord, to act as a weathervane! Instead, she ended up here in the middle of Tøyenparken, where she's kept silent vigil since 1981!
