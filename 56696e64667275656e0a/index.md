#  Well done, you've found the second post!

This stone statue called _Vindfruen_ made by Ole Kristian Sjølie was originally intended to be floating statue anchored up in the Oslo fjord, to act as a weathervane! Instead, she ended up here in the middle of Tøyenparken, where she's kept silent vigil since 1981!

### Task

_The statue has a rather magnificent pose! Can you replicate it? Remember to document!_

### Clue to next post:

_The place to go if you have questions about climate change._
