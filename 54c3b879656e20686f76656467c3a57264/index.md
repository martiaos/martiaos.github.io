#  Well done, you've found the fifth post!

Congrats - you're halfway there!

Parts of the building in front of you, _Tøyen Hovedgård_, was built in 1679, meaning that this is probably the oldest preserved building made of timber in Oslo/Akershus!

### Task

_What is the name of Oslo's longest river?_

### Clue to next post:

_A small garden with rosemary, thyme and all that smells good._

(Warning: There are two spice-areas, you're looking for the one next to the Museum of Natural History)
